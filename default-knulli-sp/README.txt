About this bezel set
====================

This bezel set was created to be used with KNULLI, a custom
firmware for retro gaming handhelds. You can find the latest
version of this bezel set here:
https://github.com/chrizzo-hb/knulli-bezels

The bezel set was not designed by the KNULLI team. It was
compiled from different sources to create a consistent
bezel set for every type of screen currently supported by
KNULLI.
