# knulli-bezels

A compilation of bezels to be used with [Knulli](https://knulli.org).

Knulli is an open-source custom firmware (CFW) for handheld retro gaming devices. It is a fork of [Batocera](https://batocera.org).

This bezel set is maintained as a multi-resolution bezel set to be used with Knulli, which has recently adopted the capability of handling bezel sets with bezels for multiple different resolutions ([read more here](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/pull/131)). Multi-resolution bezel sets allow the users to choose a single bezel set which works just as well with the built-in OS screen as it does with a 16:9 TV set.

To keep it lightweight, balanced, and consistent, this bezel pack contains

* System-specific bezels only (**no** game-specific bezels)
* **Gridless** bezels only
* 16:9 bezels mostly adopted directly from Batocera
* 4:3 bezels with priority of **maxing out screen size** over integer scaling
* Hardware-focused designs
