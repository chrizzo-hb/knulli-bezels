# knulli-bezels

A compilation of bezels to be used with [Knulli](https://knulli.org/).

This bezel set is maintained as a multi-resolution bezel set to be used with Knulli, which has recently adopted the capability of handling bezel sets with multiple different resolutions ([read more here](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/pull/131)).

I did not create any of the bezels in this set and I do not claim any ownership. Please be aware of the different licenses under which these works have been published.
